#go workspace and execute ps1 scripts

#distribute the generic package
curl -uadmin  -X POST http://ubuntu:8081/artifactory/api/distribute  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -T distrib.json

#then show
see product, 2 packages
edit product, add logo, description...

EULA
add new EULA
_All_ your base belong to *us*

attach the eula to version 1.0 (which will be for docker and tgz because baserev and tagg are considered as version for the product)

New question : how to give access to the files?
    - create 1 user in bintray and manage permission in bintray
    => this is not what customer are doing, they want to manage entitlements and give acces key

#create access key
jfrog bt acc-keys --org=jfrog-int create pizza-webinar-jr

#create an entitlement to give read permisssion
jfrog bt ent --access=r --keys=pizza-webinar-jr create jfrog-int/pizza-registry-jr
jfrog bt ent --access=r --keys=pizza-webinar-jr create jfrog-int/pizza-generic-jr

#download the file using entitlement (first attempt failed because EULA is not signed)
curl -L -upizza-webinar-jr@jfrog-int "https://jfrog-int.bintray.com/pizza-generic-jr/jfrog/bintray/bintray-webinar/pizza/pizza-1.0.tgz" -o pizza.tgz -k -v

#go  to https://bintray.com/jfrog-int/product/pizza-test-jr/1.0/accept_eula and sign in and accept eula,

#SHOW THE EULA TRACKING page and eventually detailed permission on repo

# then re download

#then docker login
docker login -u pizza-webinar-jr@jfrog-int  jfrog-int-docker-pizza-test-jr.bintray.io

#finally pull the image
docker pull jfrog-int-docker-pizza-test-jr.bintray.io/pizza:1.0

Q?
How do I embed this in my website (I don't want to go to Bintray UI) => the question is in fact how I connect a nice UI provided by my front end devs to Bintray => answer is throught the REST API
what is the diff between product and repositories?
